            Eye on the TV  <br>
            'Cause tragedy thrills me <br>
            Whatever flavour <br>
            It happens to be like; <br>
            Killed by the husband <br>
            Drowned by the ocean <br>
            Shot by his own son <br>
            She used the poison in his tea <br>
            And kissed him goodbye <br>
            That's my kind of story <br>
            It's no fun 'til someone dies <br>
            Don't look at me like <br>
            I am a monster <br>
            Frown out your one face <br>
            But with the other <br>
            Stare like a junkie <br>
            Into the TV <br>
            Stare like a zombie <br>
            While the mother <br>
            Holds her child <br>
            Watches him die <br>
            Hands to the sky crying <br>
            Why, oh why? <br> <br>
            'Cause I need to watch things die <br>
            From a distance <br>
            Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies <br>
            You all need it too, don't lie <br>
            Why can't we just admit it? <br>
            Why can't we just admit it? <br>
            We won't give pause until the blood is flowing <br>
            Neither the brave nor bold
            The writers of stories sold <br>
            We won't give pause until the blood is flowing <br>
            I need to watch things die <br>
            From a good safe distance <br>
            Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies <br>
            You all feel the same so <br>
            Why can't we just admit it? <br> <br>
            Blood like rain come down <br>
            Drawn on grave and ground <br>
            Part vampire <br>
            Part warrior <br>
            Carnivore and voyeur <br>
            Stare at the transmittal <br>
            Sing to the death rattle <br>
            La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie <br>
            Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men. <br>
            Pull your head on out your hippy haze and give a listen. <br>
            Shouldn't have to say it all again. <br>
            The universe is hostile. so Impersonal. devour to survive. <br>
            So it is. So it's always been. <br>
            We all feed on tragedy <br>
            It's like blood to a vampire <br>
            Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies <br>
            Much better you than I <br>
